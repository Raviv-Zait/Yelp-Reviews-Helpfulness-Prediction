This project's goal is to use Neural Network models to predict Yelp reviews 'Usefulness' score, i.e., how many Yelp users will vote for a given review as "Useful" to their decision of whether to buy from that business or not. For this purpose, I will use a dataset containing Yelp reviews of coffee shops in Boston, scraped using "Yelp Scraper" from Apify.com. The downloaded data includes 200 businesses on Yelp.com that matched the search keyword "Coffee" in the location "Boston". Businesses in the dataset have up to 100 reviews each, and after removing missing texts the dataset has 14,500 reviews.

Throughout this project, I am experimenting with different NN models and architectures, some of which were constrained by computing limitations. Overall, different models reach similar scores of around 65-70% accuracy for usefulness in the binary classification, and 60% in the multi-class prediction. I also build a multiple-output model to predict a binary classification of all 3 labels at once, and use cosine similarity to compare reviews with different labels.
